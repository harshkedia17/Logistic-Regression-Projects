# Logistic Regression Project
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
## This folder contains project made using Logistic Regression which includes :
* Titanic Survivor Prediction
  * For this project we will be working with the [Titanic Data Set from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). 
We'll be trying to predict a classification- survival or deceased.
Let's begin our understanding of implementing Logistic Regression in Python for classification. The data has been divided into two parts train.csv and test.csv 


* Advertisement Clicked Prediction
  * In this project we will be working with a fake advertising data set, indicating whether or not a particular internet user clicked on an Advertisement on a company website. We will try to create a model that will predict whether or not they will click on an ad based off the features of that user.

## The file consists of the csv data and the jupyter notebook of the above projects.
